# Barcode Buddy Python — Home Assistant Add-on Repository

Modern Python-based barcode scanner with Grocy integration for Home Assistant.

> ### ⚠️ This is a fork
>
> Upstream is **[sitaro/barcodebuddy-python](https://github.com/sitaro/barcodebuddy-python)**
> by Mathias Päzolt — all the credit for this add-on belongs there. This fork exists
> for one behavioural change: **unknown barcodes are auto-created instead of parked in
> a pending queue** ("fire-and-forget" scanning).
>
> | | |
> |---|---|
> | **Fork branch** | `fire-and-forget` — the only branch with changes |
> | **Pinned to upstream** | `new-features` @ `e76a458` (v2.18.2-beta) |
> | **Mirrors** | `main`, `new-features`, `mode_switch` are untouched copies of upstream |
>
> If you want the original behaviour, use upstream. See
> [the add-on README](barcodebuddy/README.md#-fork-behaviour-fire-and-forget) for what
> changed and why.

## Installation

1. Add this repository to Home Assistant:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **Add-on Store** (three dots menu) → **Repositories**
   - For the fork: `https://github.com/tonyinwi/barcodebuddy-python` (see the note below)
   - For upstream: `https://github.com/sitaro/barcodebuddy-python`

> **Why the fork's URL still says `tonyinwi`:** the repo moved to
> [worthingtony/barcodebuddy-python](https://github.com/worthingtony/barcodebuddy-python)
> on 2026-10-09, and GitHub redirects the old address. The house install keeps the old
> store URL on purpose: Supervisor names an add-on after `sha1(store URL)[:8]`, which gives
> `c308acc8_barcodebuddy-python` here, so a new URL installs a new add-on and loses its
> config. Never create or fork a repo called `barcodebuddy-python` under `tonyinwi`, because
> that kills the redirect. A fresh install elsewhere can use the `worthingtony` URL.

2. Install the **Barcode Buddy Python** add-on

3. Configure and start the add-on

> **Using the fork's behaviour:** Home Assistant installs from the repository's default
> branch. To run the patched version, point the add-on repository at the
> `fire-and-forget` branch (or make it this fork's default branch). Reload the add-on
> after switching.
